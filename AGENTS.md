# AGENTS.md — Post-Compact Reminder for Claude Code

> Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this Bash/Shell codebase.

---

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PREROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

> **Note:** This project helps protect AI agents from running dangerous commands. Practice what we preach.

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing
- **The `master` branch must stay synchronized with `main`** — after pushing to `main`, also push to `master`:
  ```bash
  git push origin main:master
  ```

**If you see `master` referenced anywhere:**
1. Update it to `main`
2. Ensure `master` is synchronized: `git push origin main:master`

---

## Toolchain: Bash & Shell Scripts

This project uses **Bash** shell scripts exclusively.

- **Shell compatibility:** Bash 4.0+ (uses features like associative arrays)
- **Dependencies:** `jq` (JSON parsing), `python3` (JSON manipulation)
- **Configuration:** Shell scripts with embedded documentation
- **Style:** Use `set -e` for fail-fast, quote variables, use `[[` over `[`

### Key Dependencies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jq` | Parse JSON input from Claude Code hooks |
| `python3` | Atomic JSON manipulation for settings.json |
| `bash` | Script interpreter |
| `curl` | Self-update functionality |

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

- **Always make code changes manually**, even when there are many instances
- For many simple changes: use parallel subagents
- For subtle/complex changes: do them methodically yourself

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `install-v2.sh`
- `install_improved.sh`
- `install_enhanced.sh`

New files are reserved for **genuinely new functionality** that makes zero sense to include in any existing file. The bar for creating new files is **incredibly high**.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test hook with compact source (should output reminder)
echo '{"session_id": "test-123", "source": "compact"}' | \
  ~/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder

# Expected output:
# Context was just compacted. Please reread AGENTS.md...

# Test hook with startup source (should output nothing)
echo '{"session_id": "test-123", "source": "startup"}' | \
  ~/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder
```

### Installer Testing

```bash
# Dry run (preview changes)
./install-post-compact-reminder.sh --dry-run

# Check installation status
./install-post-compact-reminder.sh --status

# Force reinstall
./install-post-compact-reminder.sh --force

# Uninstall
./install-post-compact-reminder.sh --uninstall
```

---

## Shell Script Quality Checks

**After any substantive code changes, verify the scripts work correctly:**

```bash
# Check bash syntax
bash -n install-post-compact-reminder.sh

# Run shellcheck if available
shellcheck install-post-compact-reminder.sh

# Test the hook
echo '{"source": "compact"}' | ~/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder
```

---

## Post-Compact Reminder — This Project

**This is the project you're working on.** Post-Compact Reminder is a Claude Code hook that automatically reminds Claude to re-read AGENTS.md after context compaction, ensuring project conventions are maintained throughout long coding sessions.

### Architecture

```
Context fills up → Compaction → SessionStart (source: "compact") → Hook fires → Reminder injected → Claude re-reads AGENTS.md
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `install-post-compact-reminder.sh` | Main installer script (~60KB) with full CLI |
| `README.md` | User documentation and quick start guide |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent guidelines (this file) |

### How It Works

1. Claude Code compacts context when it gets too long
2. After compaction, `SessionStart` hook fires with `source: "compact"`
3. The `matcher: "compact"` in settings.json triggers our hook
4. Hook outputs a reminder message
5. Claude sees the reminder and re-reads AGENTS.md

### Installation Locations

| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| Hook script | `~/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder` |
| Configuration | `~/.claude/settings.json` |

### Hook Output Format

When triggered, the hook outputs:

```
Context was just compacted. Please reread AGENTS.md to refresh your understanding
of project conventions and agent coordination patterns.
```

### Settings.json Configuration

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "compact",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.local/bin/claude-post-compact-reminder"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Installer CLI Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `./install-post-compact-reminder.sh` | Install the hook |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without modifying anything |
| `--force` | Reinstall even if already installed |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the hook completely |
| `--status` | Check installation health |
| `--interactive` | Choose message template interactively |
| `--template <name>` | Apply preset (minimal, detailed, checklist, default) |
| `--diff` | Compare installed vs. new version |
| `--restore` | Restore from backup |
| `--update` | Self-update from GitHub |
| `--completions <shell>` | Generate bash/zsh completions |

## MCP Agent Mail — Multi-Agent Coordination

A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources. Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

### Why It's Useful

- **Prevents conflicts:** Explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs
- **Token-efficient:** Messages stored in per-project archive, not in context
- **Quick reads:** `resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`

### Same Repository Workflow

1. **Register identity:**
   ```
   ensure_project(project_key=<abs-path>)
   register_agent(project_key, program, model)
   ```

2. **Reserve files before editing:**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)
   ```

3. **Communicate with threads:**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")
   fetch_inbox(project_key, agent_name)
   acknowledge_message(project_key, agent_name, message_id)
   ```

4. **Quick reads:**
   ```
   resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20
   resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true
   ```

### Macros vs Granular Tools

- **Prefer macros for speed:** `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`
- **Use granular tools for control:** `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`

### Common Pitfalls

- `"from_agent not registered"`: Always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first
- `"FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT"`: Adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use non-exclusive reservation
- **Auth errors:** If JWT+JWKS enabled, include bearer token with matching `kid`

---

## Beads (br) — Dependency-Aware Issue Tracking

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and CLI (`br` - beads_rust) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging and file reservations.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER runs git commands automatically. You must manually commit changes after `br sync --flush-only`.

### Conventions

- **Single source of truth:** Beads for task status/priority/dependencies; Agent Mail for conversation and audit
- **Shared identifiers:** Use Beads issue ID (e.g., `br-123`) as Mail `thread_id` and prefix subjects with `[br-123]`
- **Reservations:** When starting a task, call `file_reservation_paths()` with the issue ID in `reason`

### Typical Agent Flow

1. **Pick ready work (Beads):**
   ```bash
   br ready --json  # Choose highest priority, no blockers
   ```

2. **Reserve edit surface (Mail):**
   ```
   file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="br-123")
   ```

3. **Announce start (Mail):**
   ```
   send_message(..., thread_id="br-123", subject="[br-123] Start: <title>", ack_required=true)
   ```

4. **Work and update:** Reply in-thread with progress

5. **Complete and release:**
   ```bash
   br close 123 --reason "Completed"
   br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (no git operations)
   ```
   ```
   release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])
   ```
   Final Mail reply: `[br-123] Completed` with summary

### Mapping Cheat Sheet

| Concept | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Mail `thread_id` | `br-###` |
| Mail subject | `[br-###] ...` |
| File reservation `reason` | `br-###` |
| Commit messages | Include `br-###` for traceability |

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

## UBS — Ultimate Bug Scanner

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

### Commands

```bash
ubs file.sh file2.sh                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=bash,sh scripts/             # Language filter
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
```

### Fix Workflow

1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Important:** `br` is non-invasive—it NEVER executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# CLI commands for agents
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason "Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (NO git operations)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Run `br sync --flush-only` then manually commit

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything together
git push                # Push to remote
```

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Test scripts, shellcheck
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL (no git ops)
   git add .beads/         # Stage beads changes
   git add <other files>   # Stage code changes
   git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

Note for Codex/GPT-5.2:

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in some_file.sh, another_file.sh. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

---

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
